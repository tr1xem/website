Long Story Short I own a `Dell G15 5530` laptop. Specs `RTX 4050` and `i7 13650HX`

I have been rocking Arch linux on it daily and it never disappoints.The Specs are great for 1080p gaming and each of the components works and fully support linux.
The Device got amazing cooling system it never gets hots unlike other laptops but it makes a lot of sound on G-Mode.

CPU is power hungry so it is recommended to use it with turbo boost off (in most of the game the fps drop is not that big) but it gets significantly cooler.

Looks are great its like a tank, Build is solid and screen is great.

Overall the laptop is solid and great.
