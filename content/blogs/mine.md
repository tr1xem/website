This Time the plan is simple learn the syntax which i already know Solve some [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/)

The Final target would be me rewriting whole of the AWCC again in C++ (i hope)

As far of the C++ i have learnt the basics of C++ and i am ready to start the advent of code challenges

Are you a

```cpp

#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello World!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}

```

guy or

```cpp
